    <p>My name is Riaan De Villiers, I was born in South Africa in the year 1999 and was raised in different places such as Etheopia, Zambia and different locations within South Africa. This has all thaught me to work and with different peronalities, ethnic groups an cultures. I love working together with people
      and I also find it easy to find my feet by my self in changing surcumstances! No matter the surcumstance I may be in ,my head will always be up and my eyes forward. Being positive is what helps me make the most of every moment. I don't take critique in a negative way but I rather see it as a possible
      wake-up call to change my view and better the thing that I'm critisized about.</p>
